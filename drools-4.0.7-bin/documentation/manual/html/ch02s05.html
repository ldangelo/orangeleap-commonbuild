    rules which are fed into a parser - defined by an Antlr 3 grammar. The
    parser checks for correctly formed grammar and produces an intermediate
    structure for the "descr"; where the "descr" indicates the AST that
    "describes" the rules. The AST is then passed to the Package Builder which
    produces Packages. Package Builder also undertakes any code generation and
    compilation that is necessary for the creation of the Package. A Package
    object is self contained and deployable, in that it's a serialized object
    consisting of one or more rules.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e748"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../shared/images/Chapter-Rule_Engine/Authoring.png" align="middle" alt="Authoring Components"></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.10.&nbsp;Authoring Components</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"><p>A RuleBase is a runtime component which consists of one or more

    consists of a number of sub components, including Working Memory Event
    Support, Truth Maintenance System, Agenda and Agenda Event Support. Object
    insertion may result in the creation of one or more Activations. The

    expensive.</p><p>A Rule Base instance is thread safe, in the sense that you can have
    the one instance shared across threads in your application, which may be a
    web application, for instance. The most common operation on a rulebase is
    to create a new rule session; either stateful or stateless.</p><p>The Rule Base also holds references to any stateful session that it
    has spawned, so that if rules are changing (or being added/removed etc.
    for long running sessions), they can be updated with the latest rules
    (without necessarily having to restart the session). You can specify not
    to maintain a reference, but only do so if you know the Rule Base will not
    be updated. References are not stored for stateless sessions.</p><pre class="programlisting">ruleBase.newStatefulSession();  // maintains a reference.

      WorkingMemory.insert(yourObject) for example. When you insert a fact, it
      is examined for matches against the rules etc. This means ALL of the
      work is done during insertion; however, no rules are executed until you
      call "fireAllRules()". You don't call "fireAllRules()" until after you
      have finished inserting your facts. This is a common misunderstanding by
      people who think the work happens when you call "fireAllRules()". Expert
      systems typically use the term "assert" or "assertion" to refer to facts
      made available to the system, however due to the assert become a keyword
      in most languages we have moved to use the "Insert" keyword; so expect
      to hear the two used interchangeably.</p><p>When an Object is insert it returns a FactHandle. This FactHandle

      return of a new FactHandle, if an instance is asserted twice then it
      returns the previous fact handle &#8211; i.e. it ignores the second insertion
      for the same fact.</p><p>Equality means the Working Memory uses a HashMap to store all

      that it is possible to have rules that depend on the "non existence" of
      a fact, in which case retracting a fact may cause a rule to activate
      (see the 'not' and 'exist' keywords). Retraction is done using the

      facts are cached copies of object asserted to the working memory. The
      term shadow facts is commonly known as a feature of JESS (Java Expert
      System Shell).</p><p>The origins of shadow facts traces back to the concept of truth
      maintenance. The basic idea is that an expert system should guarantee
      the derived conclusions are accurate. A running system may alter a fact
      during evaluation. When this occurs, the rule engine must know a
      modification occurred and handle the change appropriately. There's
      generally two ways to guarantee truthfulness. The first is to lock all
      the facts during the inference process. The second is to make a cache
      copy of an object and force all modifications to go through the rule
      engine. This way, the changes are processed in an orderly fashion.
      Shadow facts are particularly important in multi-threaded environments,
      where an engine is shared by multiple sessions. Without truth
      maintenance, a system has a difficult time proving the results are
      accurate. The primary benefit of shadow facts is it makes development
      easier. When developers are forced to keep track of fact modifications,
      it can lead to errors, which are difficult to debug. Building a
      moderately complex system using a rule engine is hard enough without
      adding the burden of tracking changes to facts and when they should
      notify the rule engine.</p><p>Drools 4.0 has full support for Shadow Facts implemented as
      transparent lazy proxies. Shadow facts are enable by default and are not
      visible from external code, not even inside code blocks on rules.</p><p class="remark"><i><span class="remark">I<span class="bold"><strong>MPORTANT: </strong></span>since Drools
      implements Shadow Facts as Proxies, the fact classes must <span class="bold"><strong>either be immutable</strong></span> or <span class="bold"><strong>should not be final</strong></span>, nor have final methods. If a
      fact class is final or have final methods and is still a mutable class,
      the engine is not able to create a proper shadow fact for it and results
      in unpredictable behavior. </span></i></p><p>Although shadow facts are a great way of ensuring the engine
      integrity, they add some overhead to the the reasoning process. As so,
      Drools 4.0 supports fine grained control over them with the ability to
      enable/disable them for each individual class. </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e983"></a>2.5.4.6.1.&nbsp;When is it possible to disable Shadow Facts?</h5></div></div></div><p>It is possible to disable shadow facts for your classes if you
        meet the following requirements:</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>1. Immutable classes are safe:</strong></span>
        if a class is immutable it does not require shadow facts. Just to
        clarify, a class is immutable from the engine perspective if once an
        instance is asserted into the working memory, no attribute will change
        until it is retracted.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>2. Inside your rules, attributes are only
        changed using modify() blocks:</strong></span> both Drools dialects (MVEL

      agenda).</p><p>The default conflict resolution strategies emplyed by Drools are:
      Salience and LIFO (last in, first out).</p><p>The most visible one is "salience" or priority, in which case a

      a higher number) then other rules. In that case, the higher salience
      rule will always be preferred. LIFO priorities based on the assigned
      Working Memory Action counter value, multiple rules created from the

      arbitrary.</p><p>As a general rule, it is a good idea not to count on the rules
      firing in any particular order, and try and author the rules without

      can also have rules "auto focus" which means the focus for its agenda
      group is taken when that rules conditions are true.</p><p>They are sometimes known as "modules" in CLIPS terminology. Agenda
      groups are a handy way to create a "flow" between grouped rules. You can
      switch the group which has focus either from within the rule engine, or

With
    logical assertions, the fact that was asserted will be automatically
    retracted when the conditions that asserted it in the first place are no
    longer true (it's actually more clever then that! If there are no possible
    conditions that could support the logical assertion, only then will it be
    retracted).</p><p>Normal insertions are said to be &#8220;STATED&#8221; (ie The Fact has been
    stated - just like the intuitive concept). Using a HashMap and a counter
    we track how many times a particular equality is STATED; this means we
    count how many different instances are equal. When we logically insert an
    object we are said to justify it and it is justified by the firing rule.
    For each logical insertion there can only be one equal object, each
    subsequent equal logical insertion increases the justification counter for
    this logical assertion. As each justification is removed when we have no
    more justifications the logical object is automatically retracted.</p><p>If we logically insert an object when there is an equal STATED
    object it will fail and return null. If we STATE an object that has an
    exist equal object that is JUSTIFIED we override the Fact - how this
    override works depends on the configuration setting
    "WM_BEHAVIOR_PRESERVE". When the property is set to discard we use the
    existing handle and replace the existing instance with the new Object -
    this is the default behavior - otherwise we override it to STATED but we
    create an new FactHandle.</p><p>This can be confusing on a first read, so hopefully the flow charts
    below help. When it says that it returns a new FactHandle, this also
    indicates the Object was propagated through the network.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e1210"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../shared/images/Chapter-Rule_Engine/Stated_Assertion.png" align="middle" alt="Stated Insertion"></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.26.&nbsp;Stated Insertion</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"><div class="figure"><a name="d0e1218"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../shared/images/Chapter-Rule_Engine/Logical_Assertion.png" align="middle" alt="Logical Insertion"></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.27.&nbsp;Logical Insertion</b></p></div><br class="figure-break"><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e1226"></a>2.5.8.1.&nbsp;Example Scenario</h4></div></div></div><p>An example may make things clearer. Imagine a credit card
      processing application, processing transactions for a given account (and
      we have a working memory accumulating knowledge about a single accounts
      transaction). The rule engine is doing its best to decide if
      transactions are possibly fraudulent or not. Imagine this rule base
      basically has rules that kick in when there is "reason to be suspicious"
      and when "everything is normal".</p><p>Of course there are many rules that operate no matter what
      (performing standard calculations, etc.). Now there are possibly many
      reasons as to what could trigger a "reason to be suspicious": someone
      notifying the bank, a sequence of large transactions, transactions for
      geographically disparate locations or even reports of credit card theft.
      Rather then smattering all the little conditions in lots of rules,
      imagine there is a fact class called "SuspiciousAccount".</p><p>Then there can be a series of rules whose job is to look for
      things that may raise suspicion, and if they fire, they simply insert a
      new SuspiciousAccount() instance. All the other rules just have
      conditions like "not SuspiciousAccount()" or "SuspiciousAccount()"
      depending on their needs. Note that this has the advantage of allowing
      there to be many rules around raising suspicion, without touching the
      other rules. When the facts causing the SuspiciousAccount() insertion
      are removed, the rule engine reverts back to the normal "mode" of
      operation (and for instance, a rule with "not SuspiciousAccount()" may
      kick in which flushes through any interrupted transactions).</p><p>If you have followed this far, you will note that truth
      maintenance, like logical assertions, allows rules to behave a little
      like a human would, and can certainly make the rules more
      manageable.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e1237"></a>2.5.8.2.&nbsp;Important note: Equality for Java objects</h4></div></div></div><p>It is important to note that for Truth Maintenance (and logical

      override equals and hashCode methods (from java.lang.Object) correctly.

      objects are equal in value, BOTH equals and hashCode must be overridden
      correctly, as per the Java standard.</p><p>Two objects are equal if and only if their equals methods return

    Object, and then propagate the Tuple &#8211; instead a Command Object is created
    and added to a list in the Working Memory. This Command Object holds a
    reference to the LeftInputAdapterNode and the propagated Object. This
    stops any left-input propagations at insertion time, so that we know that
    a right-input propagation will never need to attempt a join with the
    left-inputs (removing the need for left-input memory). All nodes have
    their memory turned off, including the left-input Tuple memory but
    excluding the right-input Object memory &#8211; i.e. The only node that
    remembers an insertion propagation is the right-input Object memory. Once
    all the assertions are finished, and all right-input memories populated,
    we can then iterate the list of LeftInputAdatperNode Command objects
    calling each in turn; they will propagate down the network attempting to
    join with the right-input objects; not being remembered in the left input,
    as we know there will be no further object assertions and thus
    propagations into the right-input memory.</p><p>There is no longer an Agenda, with a priority queue to schedule the

    array to place the Activation. Once all Command Objects have finished we
    can iterate our array checking each element in turn and firing the
    Activations if they exist. To improve performance in the array we remember
    record the first and last populated cells. The network is constructed
    where each RuleTerminalNode is given a sequence number, based on a
    salience number and its order of being added to the network.</p><p>Typically the right-input node memories are HashMaps, for fast
    Object retraction, as we know there will be no Object retractions, we can
    use a list when the values of the Object are not indexed. For larger
    numbers of Objects indexed HashMaps provide a performance increase; if we
    know an Object type has a low number of instances then indexing is
    probably not of an advantage and an Object list can be used.</p><p>Sequential mode can only be used with a StatelessSession and is off
    by default. To turn on either set the RuleBaseConfiguration.setSequentail
    to true or set the rulebase.conf property drools.sequential to true.
    Sequential mode can fallback to a dynamic agenda with setSequentialAgenda
    to either SequentialAgenda.SEQUENTIAL or SequentialAgenda.DYNAMIC setter
    or the "drools.sequential.agenda" property</p></div></div><div xmlns="" class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch02s04.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">2.4.&nbsp;Rete Algorithm&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="title.html">Home</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a accesskey="t" href="bk01-toc.html">ToC</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Installation and Setup (Core and IDE)</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
